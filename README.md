# Hangperson

A simple, React based Hangman game!

---

### Why?

As a coding bootcamp student, I wanted my first side project to be a game, but, I wanted to code everything from scratch (no tutorials or copying someone else's code). So I decided to make a Hangman game and gave it a Halloween theme since I set myself a deadline to deploy by Halloween.
